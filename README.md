autohome-pi
===========

Autohome-Pi should be a home automation software set fpr Raspberry Pi. 
At the beginning it is based on serveral other great projects that already do great work for their specific purpose. But i didn't find any suitable software that combines all the parts that i need for my wishes of home automation on Raspberry Pi.
So i decided to for PowerPi by Anton Hammerschmidt as the base of my home automation set. 
To add functions about temperature and humidity i found a code block from Rahul Kar for reading DHT11 DHT22 sensors with the Raspberry Pi.
For receiving 433Mhz signals i finally found the software for Ninja Blocks / rd-switch.
The next step is to combine these software sets so that they can work together an present everything on a web interface.
